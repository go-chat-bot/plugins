### Overview

This plugin de-duplicates messages sent by the bot. This can be useful to
prevent bot from repeating the same answer repeatedly within a period of time.

### Setup
Set up DEDUP_TIMEOUT env variable to number of minutes which should be
de-duplicated. Plugin defaults to 5 minutes of de-duplication unless configured
otherwise
